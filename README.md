**This repository is mostly archival.**

------------------

When I started making themes for Tumblr, I had all the time I wanted to work on whatever I wanted, but nowadays I have to worry about bills and numbers and financials. 

These days, I just can't afford the time all nine of these themes need to be kept shiny and new.

I say this is "mostly" archival because I'll still update my most popular themes (as dictated by my analytics) to resolve bugs or keep up with Tumblr Themes API changes, but I don't think I'll be adding new features or doing design overhauls.

That said, this *is* GitHub, so if you see a glaring flaw in one of these: do something about it.
